## Access Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data and calculate land use changes over time

## Description    
The R package allows users to download CDL data for any area of interest and also calculate land use changes over time, including crop rotations (e.g., corn - soybeans). 

## Package installation   
To install the package, run the following codes in R:

install.packages("devtools") # Run this if the devtools package is not installed.     
devtools::install_github("cbw1243/cdlRotate")  

## Note   
The package is still under development. I am making regular changes to the package for performance improvement. Any feedback is very welcomed.

Please use the most recent version of the package. **Install again before using it**.
