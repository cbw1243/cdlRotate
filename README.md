## cdlRotate: Access Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data and calculate land use changes over time

The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer that provides crop-specific land cover classification product of more than 100 crop categories grown in the United States over time. It is provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture. The [CropScape](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) is a an web interface to access the visualize the CDL data. 

The objective of the `cdlRotate` package

## Description    
The R package allows users to download CDL data for any area of interest and also calculate land use changes over time, including crop rotations (e.g., corn - soybeans). 

## Package installation   
To install the package, run the following codes in R:

install.packages("devtools") # Run this if the devtools package is not installed.     
devtools::install_github("cbw1243/cdlRotate")  

## Note   
The package is initially released on Feb. 27, 2020. I am seeking for user feedbacks to improve on the package. So, any feedback is very welcomed. Just a reminder: I could make changes to the package. So please use the most recent version of the package. **Install again before using it**.
